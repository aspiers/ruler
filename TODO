- offline migration doesnâ€™t work (shared ssh key  missing on nova account)

- no live migration (libvirt pieces missing, see commented out parts in openstack-quickstart/lib/functions.sh about enabling tcp listen)

- novnc console is not working (simply hangs.. the proxies are not configured correctly?)

- cinder-volume is not being setup on 2ndary nodes?
