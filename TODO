- in the dashboard in the instances view, every 2nd time on viewing the list or so there is an error message „can not retrieve volume list“

- the controller node does not get a default route to the outside

- VMs are not reachable via floating ip from the controller node (or fixed for that matter)

- offline migration doesn’t work (shared ssh key  missing on nova account)

- no live migration (libvirt pieces missing, see commented out parts in openstack-quickstart/lib/functions.sh about enabling tcp listen)

- webui is extremely extremely slow (dns lookup hangs?)

- novnc console is not working (simply hangs.. the proxies are not configured correctly?)
